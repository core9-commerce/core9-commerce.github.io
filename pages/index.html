		<h1>Business-driven development</h1>
		<p>Business-driven development is a methodology for developing IT
			solutions that directly satisfy business requirements. This is
			achieved by adopting a model-driven approach that starts with the
			business strategy, requirements and goals and then transforms them
			into an IT solution. The transformation is typically achieved by
			applying model transformations. Due to the alignment of the business
			layer and the IT layer, it is possible to propagate changes of the
			business automatically to the IT systems. This leads to increased
			flexibility and shorter turnaround times when changing the business
			and adapting the IT systems.</p>
		<p>Business-driven development goes further than the simple
			development of delivered requirements in that the implementing
			resource seeks to both completely understand the business side during
			the iterative gathering and implementing of requirements and drives
			to, once acquiring that information, improve business processes
			itself during the development of the actual solution.</p>
